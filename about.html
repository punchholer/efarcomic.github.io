                <h1>Synopsis</h1>
                <p><strong>Escape From Abject Reality</strong> is a webcomic that was created in September 24th, 2017.
                    It is
                    a story about 12 objects who are trapped in a dangerous â€˜reality show', and they have to constantly
                    avoid lethal obstacles that the sadistic host, Snake Oil has in store for them. Secrets lurk at
                    every corner, as the game and their fellow companions are not what they seem to be. Will they
                    eventually find a way out, or succumb to the never-ending hopelessness of Abject Reality?</p>

                                    series?</strong></span>
                        </div>
                        <p>This series was inspired by
                            the Object Show
                            subculture, and based on webseries such as 'Battle For Dream Island' and 'Inanimate
                            Insanity'. Back in
                            2017, I wanted to make my own spin on the genre due to my own interest in psychological
                            horror
                            stories, and created a comic based on these ideas. Another source of inspiration with the
                            the pilot episode of Infinity Train, and escape rooms.</p>

                        <p> For the very first few pages, Clip Studio Pro was used, but from 2017-2022, I used Medibang
                            Paint on the ipad and would usually create one large page
                            before splitting them into parts. From 2023 onwards, I use Clip Studio EX on the desktop.

                        <p>Comicfury was a very reliable website to host EFARcomic, but I have always wanted to add more
                            functionality and features (and ads. Sorry I had to.) for my comic. I created this
                            website using the Rarebit template
                            made by Geno7, modified it to my liking, and hosted it on Github and Cloudflare. It
                            definitely took a while to create some of the functionality without much knowledge of
                            Javascript and HTML, so I hope it's worth it!</p>
