        <h2>About The Author</h2>
        <div id="authorBlurb">
            <p>Hello! you can call me Punch, which is short for my handle, <strong>Punch-Holer/PunchyHolery</strong>. This series was inspired by the Object Show subculture, and based on webseries such as 'Battle For Dream Island' and 'Inanimate Insanity'. Back in 2017, I wanted to make my own spin on the genre due to my own interest in psychological horror stories, and created a comic based on these ideas. Escape From Abject reality holds a special place in my heart and lives rent-free in my head, and it will always be a free to read comic for everyone to enjoy, or weep at. If you would like to support the comic, you can help spread the word about it on social media websites, or you can buy me a Ko-Fi!
