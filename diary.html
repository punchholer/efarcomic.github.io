                <p>Dear Diary,</p>
                <p>Looks like this is the very first entry of this diary! I've bought one that looks
                    quite plain, so I drew some flowers on it! Everyone had always told me that I have to stay
                    organized, so this should help me with keeping track of my day to day life. Maybe this will
                    help me remember that life isn't so dull, so that I can appreciate the little things in
                    it.</p>
                <p>Speaking about dull, I've started working in this studio that does reality show stuff.
                    I'm not too big of a fan of reality shows, but dressing objects up is what I can see
                    myself doing for a long time. There's hasn't been any work so far, since everything is still
                    being set up! Hopefully I can meet a future celebrity... how exciting!! Hopefully this job won't
                    be as boring as I thought it would be.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="page">
                <p>Dear Diary,</p>
                <p>First day of work went pretty well! I got to take a tour of the studio. I didn't know there's a
                    legacy behind these shows, I thought they're just created for pure entertainment! They said that
                    they wanted to try something new, but still having a celebrity host. Xir Elixir, I
                    think? I know they have their fans, all so mesmerized over their sense of style. Personally not my
                    thing, but it would be an honor to work with them!</p>
                <p>So this show I'm working on is set in a living space, where competitiors have to do challenges in
                    certain rooms. They wanted everything to be as 'real' and 'relatable' as possible. They wanted
                    something minimal, and not too garish. Maybe that's why I'm hired for this. Everyone have always
                    told
                    me that I'm too plain for the cameras.</p>
                <p>What's weird is that I don't think this Elixir host and 'realness' mix well. Weren't they known for
                    their ethereal charm? Maybe they are seeking something new after all.</p>

            <div class="page">
                <p>Dear Diary,</p>
                <p>We got to see the host and the contestants today! This Elixir fellow does have an interesting
                    aura to xem.
                    Maybe it's xeir eyes, or how relaxed xey are. Xey wore xeir trademark silver suit and tie that
                    shimmers in the light, and had a gold tag with a star on it.
                    I never thought that xey could be so down to earth, especially as a famous host. Though, something
                    they've said bothered me a little. Something aboout how shows like this gave contestants a a
                    purpose?</p>

                <p> It's a pity that even as crew, we're not allowed to get too personable with the contestants, but
                    at least we know a few things that everyone else doesn't! It's funny how they claim that reality
                    shows like these aren't scripted, yet they always push the narrative to a certain goal. There's
                    a total of 12 contestants, but even if they're diverse, they seem to be picked to fit in certain
                    tropes. There's this badge guy who was an ex-cop, and the sock twins who are gossipy and only
                    talk amongst themselves. There's also this nerdy block of foam who wears a bow tie. I'm sure hope
                    they'll all get along just fine. Even if they most likely won't.</p>
