                <p>Dear Diary,</p>
                <p>Looks like this is the very first entry of this diary! I bought one that looks
                    quite plain, so I drew some flowers on it! Everyone had always told me that I have to stay
                    organized, so this should help me with keeping track of my day to day life. Maybe this will
                    help me remember that life isn't so dull, so that I can appreciate the little things in
                    it.</p>
                <p>Speaking of dull, I've started working in this studio that does reality show stuff.
                    I'm not too big of a fan of reality shows, but dressing objects up is what I can see
                    myself doing for a long time. There's hasn't been any work so far, since everything is still
                    being set up! Hopefully I can meet a future celebrity... how exciting!! Hopefully this job won't
                    be as boring as I thought it would be.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="page">
                <p>Dear Diary,</p>
                <p>First day of work went pretty well! I got to take a tour of the studio. I didn't know there's a
                    legacy behind these shows, I thought they're just created for pure entertainment! They said that
                    they wanted to try something new, but still having a celebrity host. Xir Elixir, I
                    think? I know they have their fans, all so mesmerized over their sense of style. Personally not my
                    thing, but it would be an honor to work with them!</p>
                <p>So this show I'm working on is set in a living space, where competitiors have to do challenges in
                    certain rooms. They wanted everything to be as 'real' and 'relatable' as possible. They wanted
                    something minimal, and not too garish. Maybe that's why I'm hired for this. Everyone always
                    told
                    me that I'm too plain for the cameras.</p>
                <p>What's weird is that I don't think this Elixir host and 'realness' mix well. Weren't they known for
                    their ethereal charm? Maybe they are seeking something new after all.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="page">
                <p>Dear Diary,</p>
                <p>We got to see the host and the contestants today! This Elixir fellow does have an interesting
                    aura to xem.
                    Maybe it's xeir eyes, or how relaxed xey are. Xey wore xeir trademark suit and tie that
                    shimmers in the light, and had a gold tag with a star on it.
                    I never thought that xey could be so down to earth, especially as a famous host. Though, something
                    they've said bothered me a little. Something about how shows like this gave contestants a
                    purpose?</p>

                <p> It's a pity that even as crew, we're not allowed to get too personable with the contestants, but
                    at least we know a few things that everyone else doesn't! It's funny how they claim that reality
                    shows like these aren't scripted, yet they always push the narrative to a certain goal. There's
                    a total of 12 contestants, but even if they're diverse, they seem to be picked to fit in certain
                    tropes. There's this badge guy who was an ex-cop, and the sock twins who are gossipy and only
                    talk amongst themselves. There's also this nerdy block of foam who wears a bow tie. I'm sure hope
                    they'll all get along just fine. Even if they most likely won't.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="page">
                <p>Dear Diary,</p>
                <p>Sometimes I wish I had a greater purpose in life. Something that speaks to me and drags me out of the
                    aimlessness of my life. It feels like my role is just to blend into the background, and be unseen.
                    When I was young, I was easily overlooked, and returned to an empty home. Didn’t have a lot of
                    friends either, and the ones I had drifted away. I really want to write more about my life here, but
                    lately it’s been more about work. Maybe I should call my parents…</p>

                <p>Maybe this is what this Funhouse show is going for, all this glitz and talk about high hopes for
                    the ratings. Everyone has dreams, and most of us will do whatever it takes to achieve them no matter
                    how ridiculous it is. Even if achieving their dreams takes being in a cramped room while millions of
                    people watch and judge their every action.</p>

                <p>It looks like a few of them are forming an alliance before the first challenge. Styrofoam was really
                    trying to push that idea onto Badge until he gave in. The little chili kid was messing around
                    and saying things that should be edited out. Somehow I feel bad for him, maybe his parents wanted to
                    make their kid a star.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="page">
                <p>Dear Diary,</p>
                <p>My manager, BW, had assigned me someone to work with for my training! It's rather
                    convenient that Styrofoam is the closest thing to a blank canvas... was I being mean to him? Oh
                    dear.
                    Anyway, I've taken note of all the contestants in Elixir's Funhouse! What a colorful cast. BW and
                    I are just gossiping about them.</p>
                <p>1. Pendant (He seems irritable, like a pedant)</p>
                <p> 2. Sweater (Very shy)</p>
                <p>3. TP (Rather chill and goofy)</p>
                <p>4. Badge (He's got nice arms)</p>
                <p>5. Sockette (She's the one without the glasses, I think?)</p>
                <p>6. Missy (It's short for mismatch, because they're mismatched socks)</p>
                <p>7. Perma (Poor girl what has life done to you.)</p>
                <p>8. Nail Polish (Wow, he's sassy)</p>
                <p>9. Pequin (Why do they let children participate in these...)</p>
                <p>10. Picnic Basket (A very trendy mom)</p>
                <p>11. Crystal (She told everyone that caring for the plant on her head is her one true purpose.)
                </p>
                <p>12. Styrofoam (The one I'm in charge of, maybe I should get to know him better.)</p>

            </div>

            <div class="page">
                <p>Dear Diary,</p>
                <p>Dealing with Styrofoam is easy, but he's rather picky about what he likes. He seems to be drawn
                    towards wearing a simple red bow, and I think it fits him very well too! I'm talked to him for a
                    bit. He did ask me if it's difficult dressing up an armless contestant, and it's so embarrassing of
                    me not to notice that fact! He rambled on about how he's the first ever armless reality show
                    contestant to
                    be on the show, and how much is at stake for him. He wants to make sure that he makes a good
                    impression so that people will know how powerful an armless object could be.It's so fun to listen to
                    him ramble on about his
                    past, and his interests, like engineering. He appears prideful to people who aren't close to him,
                    but there's a sense of humility in who he is. People used to mock him for his features, calling him
                    a plain, white block...</p>
                <p> Elixir's first challenge was quirky to say the least, and it's a lot like hide and seek. Half of the
                    cast has to hide and pretend to be among the inanimate objects so that they won't be found, while
                    the seekers have to find them. Foamy did decently in this challenge, since being plain does have
                    it's
                    advantage after all! The use of the bow is clever too, and he hid in a pile of presents... It's not
                    too long before Crystal Soil managed to find him!</p>
